# degeneracy-energy-state
What is orbital degeneracy and How do you find orbital degeneracy? Degenerate orbitals are orbitals that have the same energy. Each atomic orbital can have maximum of two electrons. There are only two electrons in the first shell as it has only s atomic orbitals.  How do you find orbital degeneracy? So the degeneracy of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom is n2. For example, the ground state, n = 1, has degeneracy = n2 = 1 (which makes sense because l, and therefore m, can only equal zero for this state).
